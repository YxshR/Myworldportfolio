# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A premium interactive 3D portfolio website featuring a sophisticated entrance experience and universe system where Earth rotates continuously and stars represent real-time visitors. The experience begins with an elegant landing page featuring an "Enter to my World" button with premium animations revolving around Earth. Once entered, visitors get a unique star that orbits Earth, and when they provide their email, the star falls to their geographic location based on IP address. The system provides real-time visualization of all active visitors while maintaining privacy by only showing names to the star's owner. The entire interface features premium UI/UX design with polished 3D animations, elegant typography, and luxury dark theme aesthetics.

2. WHEN there are up to 50 concurrent users THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance with real-time synchronization
3. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the 3D scene SHALL be responsive, touch-friendly, and automatically optimize performance
4. WHEN the system detects lower-end hardware THEN it SHALL automatically reduce visual quality to maintain performance
5. WHEN the Earth is rendered THEN it SHALL have semi-realistic textures with day/night mapping and subtle stylization
6. IF WebGL is not supported THEN the system SHALL display a fallback 2D version with similar functionality
